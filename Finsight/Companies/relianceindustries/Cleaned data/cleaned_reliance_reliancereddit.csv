A high dividend is not worth capital losses, especially considering the fact that dividends are taxed as income and long term capital gains are only taxed at 25% when you sell, provided you hold the asset for more than a year. Even if you’re not concerned about taxes, your initial investment being whittled down while collecting dividends isn’t fun. \n\nWith that in mind, look for total return (capital gains plus dividends). A good index that pays a decent dividend monthly is SPHD. Or, if you like real estate, O is tried and true or you can invest in the IYR or VNQ REIT indexes.\n\nIf you’re just starting out, I would stay away from individual stock picking. Once you have some money in indexes, then start to pick individual stocks. It depends on who you ask etc, but a good rule of thumb is no more than half of your portfolio in individual stocks (that’s very aggressive, a lot of people would say max 20%, but aggressive investing at the beginning of your investing career isn’t a bad thing, plus you’re more inclined to stay interested if you’re not bored). People also say no more than 5-10% of your portfolio should be in any one stock, but that rule is much less important. \n\nWhen picking individual stocks, look for companies that have paid a dividend consistently and who have increased it over time. Looking at stocks that are in the dividend aristocrats index is a good place to start. Once you have some candidates, invest in what you like.\n\nTL;DR half your portfolio should be in indexes, the other half can be in individual stocks that consistently pay and grow their dividend', 'I’m not a professional, so this is simply my opinion and in no way financial advice (don’t sue me).\n\nI have found that I tend to lean towards monthly-paying REIT’s and stocks that have a mixture of value/dividends. For examples, check out the S&P Dividend Aristocrats who have raised their dividends year over year for at least 25 years.\n\nWhen evaluating stocks, make sure you look at the payout ratio to make sure its dividends are sustainable. For REIT’s you wanna do the FFO coverage ratio (FFO per share/Dividend per share).\n\nGood luck friend!!', 'There are dividend stocks like F, RDS.B, & T that have good yields (+5%), pay quarterly, and have for some time. These are solid names so they are less risky, but you still have to review fundamentals to ensure you are not missing opportunities elsewhere.   \n\nThere are dividend funds like Pimco’s PFL that pay (+9%) monthly but have management fees. The downside are those fees, but it comes with a fund manager curating and maintaining it, taking pressure off of you. \n\nOne thing I highly suggest is the DRIP Investing website at www.dripinvesting.org/tools/tools.asp. There is a spreadsheet that lists dividend champions, contenders, with their respective information. Word of caution, do not solely invest on dividend yield.']]","['Advice on Dividend Stocks'].

A good index that pays a decent dividend monthly is SPHD. Or, if you like real estate, O is tried and true or you can invest in the IYR or VNQ REIT indexes.\n\nIf you’re just starting out, I would stay away from individual stock picking. Once you have some money in indexes, then start to pick individual stocks. It depends on who you ask etc, but a good rule of thumb is no more than half of your portfolio in individual stocks (that’s very aggressive, a lot of people would say max 20%, but aggressive investing at the beginning of your investing career isn’t a bad thing, plus you’re more inclined to stay interested if you’re not bored). People also say no more than 5-10% of your portfolio should be in any one stock, but that rule is much less important. \n\nWhen picking individual stocks, look for companies that have paid a dividend consistently and who have increased it over time. Looking at stocks that are in the dividend aristocrats index is a good place to start. Once you have some candidates, invest in what you like.\n\nTL;DR half your portfolio should be in indexes, the other half can be in individual stocks that consistently pay and grow their dividend', 'I’m not a professional, so this is simply my opinion and in no way financial advice (don’t sue me).\n\nI have found that I tend to lean towards monthly-paying REIT’s and stocks that have a mixture of value/dividends. For examples, check out the S&P Dividend Aristocrats who have raised their dividends year over year for at least 25 years.\n\nWhen evaluating stocks, make sure you look at the payout ratio to make sure its dividends are sustainable. For REIT’s you wanna do the FFO coverage ratio (FFO per share/Dividend per share).\n\nGood luck friend!!', 'There are dividend stocks like F, RDS.B, & T that have good yields (+5%), pay quarterly, and have for some time. These are solid names so they are less risky, but you still have to review fundamentals to ensure you are not missing opportunities elsewhere.   \n\nThere are dividend funds like Pimco’s PFL that pay (+9%) monthly but have management fees. The downside are those fees, but it comes with a fund manager curating and maintaining it, taking pressure off of you. \n\nOne thing I highly suggest is the DRIP Investing website at www.dripinvesting.org/tools/tools.asp. There is a spreadsheet that lists dividend champions, contenders, with their respective information. Word of caution, do not solely invest on dividend yield.']]"

Just pull up [worldmeters](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries) and look at ""Tests/1M pop"".\n\nBrazil has 11k cases, but they are only testing 258 people per every MILLION. I.e. they have no idea how many cases they have, they have very large population, more than half the US population.\n\nThen look at somewhere like\n\nPakistan: 3k cases, and testing 162 people per MILLION. 216M total people. Or,\n\nIndia: 4.3k cases, testing a whopping 102 people per MILLION, with a population of 1.37 BILLION people.\n\nThese countries are vital to the global economy. Somewhere like India for example exports a crapload of pharmaceuticals, high tech machinery for industry, computers and parts, chemicals including organic chemicals to support food production, fuels (not just oil but other mineral fuels). India has a GDP of 2.6T.\n\nEven Brazil, it has a GDP of just under 2T, and supports global industries, especially food, with soybeans, sugarcane, which are pretty vital to the overall global food industry.\n\nSum up all these ""smaller players"" (both of these are bigger GDP than Canada for example, and are 1/10th of the US GDP), and there is going to be massive disruption that is all ""hidden"" in these stats. These places aren\'t testing, likely aren\'t taking much precaution (they are taking some), and no way are going to be able to handle the kind of hospital volume that a swell in cases will bring. \n\nI don\'t for one second believe India has only 118 deaths when they aren\'t even testing people, and have population densities like they have. And even if that is real, they could be on the cusp of something truly horrifying.\n\nEconomically the impact will be massive as these disruptions ripple through the supply chain.

Federal Reserve balance sheet has swelled by almost 2T in a month. It is kind of scary what is happening right now. We have a global pandemic and are at the same time doing a massive economic stress test on a global scale.\n\nIf the Fed was just trying to keep the economy balanced and prevent free fall, then we wouldnt still be printing trillions of dollars with an market that has gone up 16% in a week.

Just pull up [worldmeters](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries) and look at ""Tests/1M pop"".\n\nBrazil has 11k cases, but they are only testing 258 people per every MILLION. I.e. they have no idea how many cases they have, they have very large population, more than half the US population.\n\nThen look at somewhere like\n\nPakistan: 3k cases, and testing 162 people per MILLION. 216M total people. Or,\n\nIndia: 4.3k cases, testing a whopping 102 people per MILLION, with a population of 1.37 BILLION people.\n\nThese countries are vital to the global economy. Somewhere like India for example exports a crapload of pharmaceuticals, high tech machinery for industry, computers and parts, chemicals including organic chemicals to support food production, fuels (not just oil but other mineral fuels). India has a GDP of 2.6T.\n\nEven Brazil, it has a GDP of just under 2T, and supports global industries, especially food, with soybeans, sugarcane, which are pretty vital to the overall global food industry.\n\nSum up all these ""smaller players"" (both of these are bigger GDP than Canada for example, and are 1/10th of the US GDP), and there is going to be massive disruption that is all ""hidden"" in these stats. These places aren\'t testing, likely aren\'t taking much precaution (they are taking some), and no way are going to be able to handle the kind of hospital volume that a swell in cases will bring. \n\nI don\'t for one second believe India has only 118 deaths when they aren\'t even testing people, and have population densities like they have. And even if that is real, they could be on the cusp of something truly horrifying.\n\nEconomically the impact will be massive as these disruptions ripple through the supply chain. Meanwhile, we have a G7 country leader in hospital (obviously extremely serious if this precaution was taken), we have 10m unemployment in the US in 2 weeks, we have disruptions extended 200% so far, and likely way way longer. \n\nMeanwhile S&P500 is up 5% this morning. Federal Reserve balance sheet has swelled by almost 2T in a month. It is kind of scary what is happening right now. We have a global pandemic and are at the same time doing a massive economic stress test on a global scale.\n\nIf the Fed was just trying to keep the economy balanced and prevent free fall, then we wouldnt still be printing trillions of dollars with an market that has gone up 16% in a week.

From casually studying a number of IPOs with its opening price and subsequent pricing over the years, a lot of parameters are in play:\n\na) Appeal to Emotions, b) an often artificially created Brand Value as suggested by lead managers whose principle aim is to make money for themselves, c) creative accounting practices to show a rosy picture of the performance of the company prior to the IPS, d) that ""red herring"" prospectus which is nothing but a parade of dishonesty e) A banking company whose aim was to obtain the future business of the company, f) a number of partners who may already have sold private share placements to family & friends to use them in the future for whatever needs to control the company.  Rarely you will see a reasonable valuation of an IPO in such a way that it rises at reasonable level in the next year to make a profit.  \n\nThat 100% dividend or 200% dividend should not be entrapping anyone.  Also if a company shows a number of private companies as ""subsidiaries"" be cautious.  They can hide a lot of profit through those companies.']]"

2020-12-08,['Why is it generally advised to invest in debt mutual funds backed by big banks?'],"[[""The goal of investing in debt funds is to avoid having to sell equities when prices have temporarily decreased. Rather, debt funds, which should be more stable, should be sold. Hence, debt funds are like a safe deposit to be used for emergencies. In exchange for stability, the returns in a fixed income portfolio are lower. Let me illustrate with a hypothetical example why chasing returns in fixed income doesn't make sense and risk (for increased returns) should be taken through equity rather than debt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCompare investing in a hypothetical company in both equity and debt. Both are traded, with the market price **only** depending on the market perception of the company. (unlikely in real life but it's an example so please bear with me)! Let us assume that each share or bond is initially priced at 100 at the start.

[[""The goal of investing in debt funds is to avoid having to sell equities when prices have temporarily decreased. Rather, debt funds, which should be more stable, should be sold. Hence, debt funds are like a safe deposit to be used for emergencies. In exchange for stability, the returns in a fixed income portfolio are lower. Let me illustrate with a hypothetical example why chasing returns in fixed income doesn't make sense and risk (for increased returns) should be taken through equity rather than debt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCompare investing in a hypothetical company in both equity and debt.

You first need to understand that this was already happening for all Liquid fund orders and any orders above Rs 2,00,000. Now, there are 2 questions to clarify- \n\n\n1- Why was this already happening for all Liquid fund orders and any orders above Rs 2,00,000? \n\n2- Why is this being extended to all orders now?\n\n\nLets answer the 1st question first with an example -\n\n1- Assume that there is an equity fund with AUM of Rs 100 Cr. On X day you notice that the market is going down drastically, lets say 10%. You are sitting on Rs 1 Cr cash yourself. Seeing the market fall, you want to take benefit of the opportunity. You place an order of Rs 1 Cr in the fund within the cut-off timing on that day. Now your order has gone to the AMC and you start expecting NAV of the same day. However, when you try to make the payment you realize that your bank is not allowing you to make that kind of transfer instantly (transaction limit). They need some time to increase transaction limit for you. You are finally able to complete the payment on the next day (X+1). You go back to living your life and assume that transaction  will get processed as expected. \n\nBut what happens at the AMCs end?\n\nLet's assume that in this case the AMC needs to allot units on the basis of date of order placement, not on the basis of funds realization. In order to do so, AMC needs to purchase equity shares worth Rs 1 Cr on X day. But where will the AMC arrange for Rs 1 Cr from? Remember, you were able to transfer your funds only by X+1 day. AMC will most likely have to take a loan to finance your purchase. In that cases, it is a cost to the fund and thereby a cost to other unit holders. \n\nWhats worse? \n\nYou did the transfer on X+1 day but that doesn't mean that the AMC will receive the money on X+1 day as well. Depending on your bank, payment method, payment gateway, AMCs bank and many more similar factors, AMC might end up receiving your money with 1-2 day delay. If AMC received the money by X+3 then in a way existing unit holders would be paying 3 days interest on your behalf in order to ensure same day NAV for you. This could be much worse if you didn't pay at all in the first place (the comment would become too long if I explain this too here, will do so in a follow up comment if people want me to). \n\n\nSo the answer to 1st question is - \n\nThis regulation was in place for liquid funds and orders above Rd 2,00,000 to make sure that existing investors of a scheme do not suffer to smoothen the entry of new investors. \n\n\nNow the 2nd question is very simple to answer - \n\nEven with 2 lakh limit, there was enough scope for the existing investors to suffer if majority of new investors in a scheme placed orders under 2L limit on a day. So, going forward, regardless of the order amount, NAV will be of the day on which AMC receives the funds.

In fact, in most common cases, it leads to _diworsification_ (this is a real term, left as an exercise to reader to look it up).\n\nOne could look for relatively uncorrelated or negatively correlated assets. But that's in relative terms, with respect to underlying stocks & geography. Buying Nifty and NASDAQ index funds, instead of two large-cap funds; would mean less correlation. But that doesn't mean Nifty and NASDAQ are not somewhat correlated.\n\nYou could also diversify across asset classes; but the problem is it tickles that part of your brain that periodically tells you to sell underperforming ones and move to winners.\n\nIn 2017, most gold funds and gold-linked assets had negative 10Y CAGR. But people who loaded up on SGB, or other gold-linked assets, and stayed with those till 2020 have gained from that massively.\n\nIn other words, diversifying across assets classes is a good idea if you can curb your return-chasing.\n\nFinally, despite having a proper asset allocation strategy (every crash, multi-asset funds start trending!), you could overall still overall underperform the market. If the goal is to have higher returns over a long enough period of time, this strategy would not make you happy. It works to reduce drawdown, not to improve returns.\n\n---\n\n> What happens if the fund house goes down (something like Franklin Templeton)?\n\nDifferent asset class; but this highlights a common problem - people often have a very binary approach to black swan events. It's as if things can only exist in either _everything alright_ or _everything blown up_. There are intermediate states.\n\nThings don't go haywire overnight. What's the _attack vector_? If an equity fund were to get into liquidity issues, how would that situation come about? What'd be the indicators of such events?\n\nEven with Franklin, it was an event that unfolded over months. Back in Sep 2019, Vodafone and telcos lost the AGR case in Supreme Court. In Jan 2020, Vodafone bonds were marked down. In Mar 2020, Liquid & UST funds started posting daily losses. End of March, Franklin Debt funds showed extremely high borrowings. Then, in April 2020, Franklin had to shut down the funds.\n\nThese news were out there, almost every financial news outlet were discussing it, even this subreddit used to have daily Franklin threads.\n\nYou cannot mitigate an imaginary unprecedented event, without knowing how it'd unfold. There's no precedent, so you have no way to prepare. There are other things in your control that you should first focus on, to improve your investment journey. A fund house going down with their equity funds due to liquidity issues, is not even one of top 20 things that'd prevent you from reaching your financial goal.""]]","['Roblox IPO', 'What are the advantages of a minimalist portfolio when it comes to investing in mutual funds?'].

There's overhead in managing more than one fund.\n\nThe question should be _what is the advantage in having more than one single fund in your portfolio?_ Or, you could ask _Is the upside of having more than one fund enough to justify the overhead of managing these?_\n\n---\n\n[Had posted this some time back, this thread might answer some of your queries & concerns](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/kgqjvg/still_on_the_fence_about_passive_investing_this/)\n\nBuying more mutual funds don't necessarily give you any added diversification. In fact, in most common cases, it leads to _diworsification_ (this is a real term, left as an exercise to reader to look it up).\n\nOne could look for relatively uncorrelated or negatively correlated assets. But that's in relative terms, with respect to underlying stocks & geography. Buying Nifty and NASDAQ index funds, instead of two large-cap funds; would mean less correlation. But that doesn't mean Nifty and NASDAQ are not somewhat correlated.\n\nYou could also diversify across asset classes; but the problem is it tickles that part of your brain that periodically tells you to sell underperforming ones and move to winners.\n\nIn 2017, most gold funds and gold-linked assets had negative 10Y CAGR. But people who loaded up on SGB, or other gold-linked assets, and stayed with those till 2020 have gained from that massively.\n\nIn other words, diversifying across assets classes is a good idea if you can curb your return-chasing.\n\nFinally, despite having a proper asset allocation strategy (every crash, multi-asset funds start trending!), you could overall still overall underperform the market. If the goal is to have higher returns over a long enough period of time, this strategy would not make you happy. It works to reduce drawdown, not to improve returns.\n\n---\n\n> What happens if the fund house goes down (something like Franklin Templeton)?\n\nDifferent asset class; but this highlights a common problem - people often have a very binary approach to black swan events. It's as if things can only exist in either _everything alright_ or _everything blown up_. There are intermediate states.\n\nThings don't go haywire overnight. What's the _attack vector_? If an equity fund were to get into liquidity issues, how would that situation come about? What'd be the indicators of such events?\n\nEven with Franklin, it was an event that unfolded over months. Back in Sep 2019, Vodafone and telcos lost the AGR case in Supreme Court. In Jan 2020, Vodafone bonds were marked down. In Mar 2020, Liquid & UST funds started posting daily losses. End of March, Franklin Debt funds showed extremely high borrowings. Then, in April 2020, Franklin had to shut down the funds.\n\nThese news were out there, almost every financial news outlet were discussing it, even this subreddit used to have daily Franklin threads.\n\nYou cannot mitigate an imaginary unprecedented event, without knowing how it'd unfold. There's no precedent, so you have no way to prepare. There are other things in your control that you should first focus on, to improve your investment journey. A fund house going down with their equity funds due to liquidity issues, is not even one of top 20 things that'd prevent you from reaching your financial goal.""]]"

Ignoring the share price and market cap, I actually like Impossible better as an investment for a few reasons:\n\n* Impossible doesn't make fake-meat for vegans, many of whom have lost their cravings for meat already. Impossible believes in making fake meat for meat lovers. If you can get meat lovers to love your fake product just as much, and bring the price down enough, that's a huge market opportunity.\n\n* I feel that Beyond is restricting themselves in ways that will hurt at decreasing costs long term, such as how they don't use GMO's.\n\n* I watched a lot of taste test videos comparing the two products head to head, and comparing it to real meat. Impossible came out ahead in taste tests far more often than Beyond Meat did (at least two thirds of the time).\n\nAll things considered, I think Impossible has great long term potential because of those things.

I will be buying in.', ""Some months ago I was doing some research into Beyond and Impossible, and comparing their products. Ignoring the share price and market cap, I actually like Impossible better as an investment for a few reasons:\n\n* Impossible doesn't make fake-meat for vegans, many of whom have lost their cravings for meat already. Impossible believes in making fake meat for meat lovers. If you can get meat lovers to love your fake product just as much, and bring the price down enough, that's a huge market opportunity.\n\n* I feel that Beyond is restricting themselves in ways that will hurt at decreasing costs long term, such as how they don't use GMO's.\n\n* I watched a lot of taste test videos comparing the two products head to head, and comparing it to real meat. Impossible came out ahead in taste tests far more often than Beyond Meat did (at least two thirds of the time).\n\nAll things considered, I think Impossible has great long term potential because of those things.

This must have taken so long to put together, so thank you!\n\nI'm curious though, in your 40 chart examples, is that an EMA/SMA that you have on in each of those? Do you mind sharing which one? I understand if not.\n\nGreat write up regardless!"", 'Nice! I trade the same patterns on the 5m.', 'Well done...Excellent writeup and graphics.', 'Holy shit this is a fantastic post', ""This is my checklist for an extremely high probability day trading setup based around compression breaks (reverse for shorts): \n\n1) Find a stock that is above the prior day high, has at least 150% rvol, that is in a sector that is strong compared to the SPY, and strong to the sector. \n\n2) Make sure there is no resistance nearby on a D1 chart, and make sure it is relatively strong to the SPY intraday (when SPY goes up, the stock really goes up. When SPY goes down, the stock goes down less than SPY or even keeps going up). The stock should be in a D1 uptrend (I like to use the D1 8ema and D1 HA candles as a general guideline to determine trend). I'm mostly looking for large caps here with consistent and orderly price action- no low float crap or 400% biotech gappers. \n\n3) Wait for the SPY to make a move up (SPY must be green on the day and above VWAP), and pull back. Your stock needs to **compress on the high of day and hold it's gains** while the SPY is pulling back. \n\n4) Set alerts above the HOD on all the stocks that fit the criteria and are compressing while the SPY is dropping \n\n5) Watch for signs that SPY is resuming it's initial bullish trend. When it does, it should push your stocks out of their compressions and trigger your alerts \n\n6) Take longs off these alerts as long as the SPY still looks like it is continuing it's bullish trend and the stock still has relative strength. I like to use an M5 close above the top of the compression and a long flat-bottom green HA candle as confirmation of the break. I also want to see high M5 volume right when the stock breaks out and instant continuation. \n\nThere are many ways you can manage these trades. You can set a small profit target and get out fast, use price action to get out when momentum starts to drop, or use  a moving average of your choice as a trailing stop if you really want to try to ride a trend. I like to scale out of these trades by taking profits in 1/4 chunks, and how much I let the position ride depends on my confidence in the market move. My line in the sand on the downside is usually a new SPY low or a break below the bottom of the compression on the stock, but I will often be out before then. \n\nIf you are patient and wait for this setup to really line up, you can get a few really high probability trades per week that you can push some pretty big size into. I prefer to only take longs when SPY is in a longer D1 uptrend and either above the prior day high, or making a very bullish move within the prior day range. Opposite for shorts. \n\nThis won't work every time but should be a decent starting point to develop a strategy around.""]]","['Become a Pattern Recognition Machine - An Obsession With Boxes']. [[""Best post I've ever come across on this sub. This must have taken so long to put together, so thank you!\n\nI'm curious though, in your 40 chart examples, is that an EMA/SMA that you have on in each of those? Do you mind sharing which one? I understand if not.\n\nGreat write up regardless!"", 'Nice! I trade the same patterns on the 5m.', 'Well done...Excellent writeup and graphics.', 'Holy shit this is a fantastic post', ""This is my checklist for an extremely high probability day trading setup based around compression breaks (reverse for shorts): \n\n1) Find a stock that is above the prior day high, has at least 150% rvol, that is in a sector that is strong compared to the SPY, and strong to the sector. \n\n2) Make sure there is no resistance nearby on a D1 chart, and make sure it is relatively strong to the SPY intraday (when SPY goes up, the stock really goes up. When SPY goes down, the stock goes down less than SPY or even keeps going up). The stock should be in a D1 uptrend (I like to use the D1 8ema and D1 HA candles as a general guideline to determine trend). I'm mostly looking for large caps here with consistent and orderly price action- no low float crap or 400% biotech gappers. \n\n3) Wait for the SPY to make a move up (SPY must be green on the day and above VWAP), and pull back. Your stock needs to **compress on the high of day and hold it's gains** while the SPY is pulling back. \n\n4) Set alerts above the HOD on all the stocks that fit the criteria and are compressing while the SPY is dropping \n\n5) Watch for signs that SPY is resuming it's initial bullish trend. When it does, it should push your stocks out of their compressions and trigger your alerts \n\n6) Take longs off these alerts as long as the SPY still looks like it is continuing it's bullish trend and the stock still has relative strength. I like to use an M5 close above the top of the compression and a long flat-bottom green HA candle as confirmation of the break. I also want to see high M5 volume right when the stock breaks out and instant continuation. \n\nThere are many ways you can manage these trades. You can set a small profit target and get out fast, use price action to get out when momentum starts to drop, or use  a moving average of your choice as a trailing stop if you really want to try to ride a trend. I like to scale out of these trades by taking profits in 1/4 chunks, and how much I let the position ride depends on my confidence in the market move.

So I think we fully recognize that it’s going to be necessary to follow through,” one of the senior administration officials said. \n\nModi’s visit comes at a time when the U.S. is adopting a strategy of “friend-shoring” as it diversifies away from China and taps into the potential of other countries in the region.\n\n“This is India’s time to drive incredible growth, and we are very much looking forward to working with the prime minister and everyone in India to achieve tremendous success together,” Applied Materials\n CEO Gary Dickerson said Wednesday in a video interview published on Modi’s official YouTube page. \n\n“Many companies around the world see the trust and tremendous talent that is in India. I deeply believe this is India’s time to shine,” Dickerson said. \n\nNASA and the Indian Space Research Organization will collaborate to work on a framework for human spaceflight cooperation this year.\n\nIndian students are “on pace to become the largest foreign student community in the United States with a 20% increase last year alone,” the officials said, adding that the U.S. government wants to welcome more Indian students and workers.\n\nThe U.S. issued 125,000 student visas to Indian nationals last year — or about one in every five student visas and more than what was issued to any other nationality, the U.S. Embassy in India said in June.', ""Submission statement: The U.S. has committed fully to developing its relationship with India, rolling out the red carpet for Modi in D.C. Alongside business deals, the U.S. is also providing new joint partnerships in the defense space, as well as even more student visas as Indians become an ever more valuable contributor to the U.S. It's clear that India will not respond to lukewarmness from the West, but seems to respond positively when it is treated well."", ""Although this is good news, I think Dickerson's quote overcooks the news a bit. This isn't so much friend-shoring as a moment of coinciding interests.

[['“India is actively engaged in diversifying away from Russian military equipment ... It is not just the United States that is engaged in that effort of diversification. It’s our allies and partners in France, in Great Britain and Israel and elsewhere that are actively supporting efforts to secure India’s defense capabilities more generally,” senior administration officials said. \n\n“I think the Indians, to be honest, have been surprised and thrilled by the steps that we’ve been able to take to remove bureaucratic roadblocks from achieving this goal. So I think we fully recognize that it’s going to be necessary to follow through,” one of the senior administration officials said. \n\nModi’s visit comes at a time when the U.S. is adopting a strategy of “friend-shoring” as it diversifies away from China and taps into the potential of other countries in the region.\n\n“This is India’s time to drive incredible growth, and we are very much looking forward to working with the prime minister and everyone in India to achieve tremendous success together,” Applied Materials\n CEO Gary Dickerson said Wednesday in a video interview published on Modi’s official YouTube page. \n\n“Many companies around the world see the trust and tremendous talent that is in India. I deeply believe this is India’s time to shine,” Dickerson said. \n\nNASA and the Indian Space Research Organization will collaborate to work on a framework for human spaceflight cooperation this year.\n\nIndian students are “on pace to become the largest foreign student community in the United States with a 20% increase last year alone,” the officials said, adding that the U.S. government wants to welcome more Indian students and workers.\n\nThe U.S. issued 125,000 student visas to Indian nationals last year — or about one in every five student visas and more than what was issued to any other nationality, the U.S. Embassy in India said in June.', ""Submission statement: The U.S. has committed fully to developing its relationship with India, rolling out the red carpet for Modi in D.C. Alongside business deals, the U.S. is also providing new joint partnerships in the defense space, as well as even more student visas as Indians become an ever more valuable contributor to the U.S. It's clear that India will not respond to lukewarmness from the West, but seems to respond positively when it is treated well."", ""Although this is good news, I think Dickerson's quote overcooks the news a bit. This isn't so much friend-shoring as a moment of coinciding interests. Both the US and India are renowned for putting their own interests first and foremost above what any friend may expect of them, which normally doesn't go well with US expectations or India's way of doing things. Will be interesting to watch how this goes."", 'It’s a big market over there, huge potential.', ""Weaning India off of Russian weapons will be a huge victory.

If there is a day where one of my listed financial instruments are trend following then i will make a killing. As of now NQ has been my go and averaging 1000 points per month with a daily target of 150. Use things like 9 ema for trend and 50SMA for direction. MACD for bull and bear strength. Use things like Break of structure and ChoCH as it respects sentiment. It respects High of day and Low of day aswell.

Rough average across brokers for maintenance is 4500. and thats 1 contract. you cannot scale out Copper/HG with that. Micro Copper would be a better idea instead of Commodity exchange(COMEX) standard contract (10x micro value per tick) Copper is beautiful to trade for trend traders which is the bread and butter of successful traders. But lets be honest, what if we get hit with a black swan or a geopolitical event or a supply and demand crash/gain whilst be on the opposite side while swinging copper? that is my curiosity and swinging is a big no no for me. especially on futures. But if we were to use my technical analysis on copper, the forward curve is bullish. We are likely to break high as its respectful of the longer term time frame. 200sma is where institutions push the price and its moving to the upside for years. we will hit 5 on the futures copper in the next few years as currently we are at 4. $1 gain on copper is $25000 on 1 standard contract.  Fundamental analysis is copper is a sought out commodity for every or most . It is used to build machines,watches,clockes,buildings,construction, consumer products, vehicles aswell. Copper has been soaring since Electrical vehicles are the new guy on the block. copper is a key component in electrical vehicles. For instance, Legendary Hedge fund manager and CEO of Pershing Square Capital  Bill ackman said if you want to invest in stocks. substantially Your DD should be considering the longevity of the stock. Think of Coca Cola, it has survived every pandemic, world war, inflation, market crash and it has been going up since 1930s. Copper is similar to that. Its longevity is substantial. If you want to take a maintenace position (swing on copper) I would place it here at 3.91 and place rought Stops at 3.8. this is under Key Demand zone on the 1 day time frame and 4.5 and 5 would be supply where sellers might short term try pushing price down. But as of now its a green light buy. BUT AT YOUR OWN RISK THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. past performance is not indictive of future results. and only risk what you can afford. Compound growth is real. Be okay with taking 10 losses even 20 in a row. Good luck with your trading and find out what works! i would also front and back test paper on copper and figure out the way it moves usually. I manage a 265000 account on crude oil futures and i risk only 0.4-0.5% each trade. average $10 barrel gains per month which is like 25,000USD per month.

I trade with Fidelity but the 3% IRA offer has me at least considering moving my IRA to Robin Hood for the cool cash. I know I need to keep the money there for 5 years. I am far enough from retirement that this shouldn\'t be a problem.\n\nMy question is, how anal is this company about Americans with legal addresses who are accessing from outside the U.S. I live in Japan much of the year, and when I just tried to make an account I got a ""making account failed, please try again later"" which feels like an automated error because I\'m coming in from outside the US. Or, it could be the other account that I appear to have made years ago which I have never used. Yes, I was using a VPN to access the site, but it still shut me down.\n\nCan anyone give me advice about how to appear like a totally new customer and coming in from the USA? I would be bringing in a sizeable amount and will be using the platform in good faith. My main goal is to get the account made so I can see what trading would be like on RH.']]"

The opportunity lies in an estimated $8 trillion to $10 trillion in new US assets, a potential 15% increase in the total market up for grabs in North America, according to the analysis.\n\nAsset managers worldwide collectively managed a record $132 trillion in June, an 8% jump from 2023 and a 21% increase from the prior year, according to the report. But the bulk of the new money went into lower-priced products, with higher-fee strategies either shrinking or stagnating. \n\n“Outsize growth requires looking beyond the zero-sum game of share gain in a static market to find new pools of assets that can increase the size of the industry’s pie,” the consultants wrote. The industry is now “equal parts a place of intense competition with challenged product segments and a market that’s ripe with promise and plenty, particularly in seizing opportunities beyond the balance sheet.”\n\nMoney managers stand to gain $5 trillion to $6 trillion of private credit and debt business from big banks pulling back lending over the next decade. Another $2 trillion to $2.5 trillion could come from the convergence of insurance and private capital, while money managers are making inroads in a $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion market investing individual wealth in private assets.', 'Wait!

Imagine if Harsaa did this for Paytm, he\'d be crying every day non stop.'], ['A major battle is being waged among money managers over as much as $10 trillion coming to the US market over the next decade from banks, insurers and wealthy retail clients, with firms needing to win the funds to bail out “leaky boats”of flatlining revenues and falling profits.\n\nThat’s according to a McKinsey & Co. analysis published Wednesday of the challenges facing asset management, which is beset by investors yanking billions of dollars from higher-fee active funds amid persistently high industry costs. The opportunity lies in an estimated $8 trillion to $10 trillion in new US assets, a potential 15% increase in the total market up for grabs in North America, according to the analysis.\n\nAsset managers worldwide collectively managed a record $132 trillion in June, an 8% jump from 2023 and a 21% increase from the prior year, according to the report. But the bulk of the new money went into lower-priced products, with higher-fee strategies either shrinking or stagnating. \n\n“Outsize growth requires looking beyond the zero-sum game of share gain in a static market to find new pools of assets that can increase the size of the industry’s pie,” the consultants wrote. The industry is now “equal parts a place of intense competition with challenged product segments and a market that’s ripe with promise and plenty, particularly in seizing opportunities beyond the balance sheet.”\n\nMoney managers stand to gain $5 trillion to $6 trillion of private credit and debt business from big banks pulling back lending over the next decade. Another $2 trillion to $2.5 trillion could come from the convergence of insurance and private capital, while money managers are making inroads in a $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion market investing individual wealth in private assets.', 'Wait!

So, our trade partners gets the largest penalty on essential goods and services that we really depend on. Those essential goods and services are going to get the highest inflation, and the relationship with our trade partners is going to be seriously damaged forever.\n\nIt will take years of inflation and building manufacturing capacity in the US until all those goods and services can be produced locally at a much higher cost.

We’re just reacting to what they did.\n\n[Trump’s Misleading Tariff Chart](https://www.factcheck.org/2025/04/trumps-misleading-tariff-chart/) \n\n>Take the European Union, for example. The chart lists its tariffs charged for U.S. imports (again, including currency manipulation or trade barriers) as 39%. Trump said the U.S. would charge countries half of what they are charging the U.S.....So in the case of the EU, the “USA Discounted Reciprocal Tariffs” is 20%, the chart states....\n\n>How does the White House arrive at 39%? In 2024, the U.S. goods trade deficit with the EU was $235.6 billion. That year, the U.S. imported $605.8 billion worth of goods from the EU. So, $235.6 divided by $605.8 is 38.9%, or, rounded up, 39%.   Economists told us that’s not a legitimate way to calculate reciprocal tariffs for countries...\n\n>as the New York Times put it, “The difference between exports and imports doesn’t necessarily reflect trade barriers; Americans may simply want to buy more stuff from, say, Japan than the Japanese want to buy from the U.S.”'], []]"

Yeah it ended up less than 1/10th of that size.', ""Trump regime is running repeated pump and dumps on Nvidia stock, aren't they?"", 'I mean, the 500 billion worth of servers NVIDIA committed will just completely surprisingly take a long time to plan so they can’t be built during trumps term and then they’ll be reassessed and they won’t build it. \n\nIt’s just like apple and all the other companies they tell trump they’ll commit money, so he has something nice to say. In reality they either planned that investment already anyways and trump had nothing to do with it remember the 500 billion AI stuff right at the beginning or they’re just saying it but they’ll just delay actually putting the money in and then kill the project as soon as they can. \n\nBut yeah the developments are still pretty shitty for NVIDIA'], ['A huge increase of spending without any particular spurt of growth means the money has to come from somewhere be it tax increases or cuts from other areas or a combination of both.', 'And if Europe\'s collective defense doesn\'t become credible enough, for which we need everyone to do their part, then a crisis/war with EU\'s eastern members will for sure shock the economy in ways that the financial damage will be greater on the western EU members who aren\'t under direct military threat than the cost of chipping in is. If there is EU - Russia war because Russia didn\'t take Europe seriously, Belgian stocks and GDP trends too will be deep in the red for a long time, and if chipping in makes the defenses that much more credible that all of that is avoided, it is a bargain.\n\nSo even from purely pragmatic, self-interested view, being cheap about collective defense is not a good move. Way to do this correctly would be that the nations that aren\'t under direct military threat try their best to find dual purpose ways to contribute. Military logistics that have a peacetime purpose as well for an example. Of course the entire military can\'t be structured like that, but finding little niches like that is a good way to bring down the overall costs.\n\nFinnish Defense Force is considered by most to be quite credible, yet it for the longest time hovered under the 2% benchmark before being in NATO. Credibility of the Finnish military is not due to excessive spending, but because of smart spending. It also helped that in late 00s/early 10s when everyone was getting rid of their military equipment, Finland was there to buy it for pittance.\n\nFor an example, Finland bought 100x Leopard 2 A6 with full maintenance kits for 200 million back in 2014 from Netherlands. Unit price for those new is at around 10million each, so Finland got them with a 80% discount. Then investing in relatively cheap things, but the things you are going to need regardless, like basic towed field artillery, shells, MANPADS and simple ""metal box on wheels"" battle taxis that won\'t kill the people inside when it hits a mine. Things that might not be very sexy nor ""game changers"" but still very annoying to deal with for the enemy or something that gives you a capability of some sort you didn\'t previously have. Then spend some money on ""bling"" in places where it\'s worth it, like with fighter jets and their missiles. Not everything needs to be Sci-Fi tech wizardry.\n\nIt also helps a ton (and is probably the primary reason tbh) that the procurement process is quite streamlined where the military tests out the competitors using its own criteria, names the winner and then if the request stays within the allocated budget, it is rubber stamped as is by the government that traditionally has always had very ""The military knows best what\'s the best for the military"" approach, regardless which party is in power. There is no party that is significantly more ""pro/anti military"" than the rest. So the process is apolitical and there isn\'t much red tape unlike in Germany where any procurement sits a decade in courts as all the contract competitors sue each other and then appeal, then appeal the appeal.\n\nMy overall point being, that military shouldn\'t be treated like a slot machine where you insert money to get some known quantity of military capabilities out. Every step of the procurement process should be considered and tailored for the nation. You can spend tons of money and get nothing of value out, or spend relatively little and get much more.', ""He is right. There will be cuts to welfare to finance. Either that, or even more taxes. But if Europe isn't willing to defend itself and spend on its defense, there soon won't be a welfare state left worth protecting. Europe needs to stand up."", 'What’s the point of having a welfare state if you can’t defend yourself and risking an overtake from a foreign invasion?', ""Belgium's defence spending is essentially in a five way tie with Spain, Luxembourg, Slovenia, and Canada for the lowest in NATO, at 1.3% of GDP. Together with Italy, Portugal, and Croatia these eight compose the rogue's gallery of delinquents who have not only failed to meet the 2% spending target, but fallen far short of it. NATO's other 23 members are at or above the target.\n\nUnder the circumstances it is hard to have sympathy for Belgian politicians whining about how hard it is to do something that most NATO members have already done. The problem isn't lack of money, it is lack of political will. Government spending accounts for over half of Belgium's GDP, among the highest in the world. There is plenty of money, but much of it isn't being spent on core priorities like defence and pensions but on the massive bloat that afflicts all Western governments.\n\nFor example, currently unemployment benefits in Belgium last *indefinitely*. The current government has proposed capping them at two years, but the fact this conversation is only occurring now when the government is under enormous pressure to get its priorities in order is indicative of the mismanagement and negligence that has been allowed to fester for years, and not only in Belgium.""], ['# Today is Wednesday, the 16th of April\n\n\n\n## Upcoming events for Wednesday, April 16th\n\n -

In reality they either planned that investment already anyways and trump had nothing to do with it remember the 500 billion AI stuff right at the beginning or they’re just saying it but they’ll just delay actually putting the money in and then kill the project as soon as they can. \n\nBut yeah the developments are still pretty shitty for NVIDIA'], ['A huge increase of spending without any particular spurt of growth means the money has to come from somewhere be it tax increases or cuts from other areas or a combination of both.', 'And if Europe\'s collective defense doesn\'t become credible enough, for which we need everyone to do their part, then a crisis/war with EU\'s eastern members will for sure shock the economy in ways that the financial damage will be greater on the western EU members who aren\'t under direct military threat than the cost of chipping in is. If there is EU - Russia war because Russia didn\'t take Europe seriously, Belgian stocks and GDP trends too will be deep in the red for a long time, and if chipping in makes the defenses that much more credible that all of that is avoided, it is a bargain.\n\nSo even from purely pragmatic, self-interested view, being cheap about collective defense is not a good move. Way to do this correctly would be that the nations that aren\'t under direct military threat try their best to find dual purpose ways to contribute. Military logistics that have a peacetime purpose as well for an example. Of course the entire military can\'t be structured like that, but finding little niches like that is a good way to bring down the overall costs.\n\nFinnish Defense Force is considered by most to be quite credible, yet it for the longest time hovered under the 2% benchmark before being in NATO. Credibility of the Finnish military is not due to excessive spending, but because of smart spending. It also helped that in late 00s/early 10s when everyone was getting rid of their military equipment, Finland was there to buy it for pittance.\n\nFor an example, Finland bought 100x Leopard 2 A6 with full maintenance kits for 200 million back in 2014 from Netherlands. Unit price for those new is at around 10million each, so Finland got them with a 80% discount. Then investing in relatively cheap things, but the things you are going to need regardless, like basic towed field artillery, shells, MANPADS and simple ""metal box on wheels"" battle taxis that won\'t kill the people inside when it hits a mine. Things that might not be very sexy nor ""game changers"" but still very annoying to deal with for the enemy or something that gives you a capability of some sort you didn\'t previously have. Then spend some money on ""bling"" in places where it\'s worth it, like with fighter jets and their missiles. Not everything needs to be Sci-Fi tech wizardry.\n\nIt also helps a ton (and is probably the primary reason tbh) that the procurement process is quite streamlined where the military tests out the competitors using its own criteria, names the winner and then if the request stays within the allocated budget, it is rubber stamped as is by the government that traditionally has always had very ""The military knows best what\'s the best for the military"" approach, regardless which party is in power. There is no party that is significantly more ""pro/anti military"" than the rest. So the process is apolitical and there isn\'t much red tape unlike in Germany where any procurement sits a decade in courts as all the contract competitors sue each other and then appeal, then appeal the appeal.\n\nMy overall point being, that military shouldn\'t be treated like a slot machine where you insert money to get some known quantity of military capabilities out. Every step of the procurement process should be considered and tailored for the nation. You can spend tons of money and get nothing of value out, or spend relatively little and get much more.', ""He is right. There will be cuts to welfare to finance. Either that, or even more taxes. But if Europe isn't willing to defend itself and spend on its defense, there soon won't be a welfare state left worth protecting. Europe needs to stand up."", 'What’s the point of having a welfare state if you can’t defend yourself and risking an overtake from a foreign invasion?', ""Belgium's defence spending is essentially in a five way tie with Spain, Luxembourg, Slovenia, and Canada for the lowest in NATO, at 1.3% of GDP. Together with Italy, Portugal, and Croatia these eight compose the rogue's gallery of delinquents who have not only failed to meet the 2% spending target, but fallen far short of it. NATO's other 23 members are at or above the target.\n\nUnder the circumstances it is hard to have sympathy for Belgian politicians whining about how hard it is to do something that most NATO members have already done. The problem isn't lack of money, it is lack of political will. Government spending accounts for over half of Belgium's GDP, among the highest in the world. There is plenty of money, but much of it isn't being spent on core priorities like defence and pensions but on the massive bloat that afflicts all Western governments.\n\nFor example, currently unemployment benefits in Belgium last *indefinitely*. The current government has proposed capping them at two years, but the fact this conversation is only occurring now when the government is under enormous pressure to get its priorities in order is indicative of the mismanagement and negligence that has been allowed to fester for years, and not only in Belgium.""], ['# Today is Wednesday, the 16th of April\n\n\n\n## Upcoming events for Wednesday, April 16th\n\n -

Once we start with chargers, move on to basic circuits, then to simple mobile components and then to complex components that require high level technical skills.\n\nThe issue is our manufacturers primarily focus on the domestic market and are unable to compete globally. Most do not even compete nationally, they cater to extremely localised markets. The problem with scaling and achieving cost efficiency is bureaucratic red tape and infra bottlenecks. If the cost of land, power and license is artificially high, then it’s not possible to compete with highly efficient and nimble Chinese manufacturers. Add to it, the high cost of capital and the entrepreneurial energy lost in dealing with entitled Indian babus. \n\nThe day political leaders and bureaucrats realise that they are the biggest hurdle to this country’s growth and reciting their functioning, we will start competing.

There have been several calls for action against Pakistan.\n\n""We have reinforced our forces because it is something which is imminent now. So in that situation, some strategic decisions have to be taken, so those decisions have been taken,"" Asif told Reuters in an interview at his office in Islamabad.\n\nAfter the Pahalgam attack, the investigation pointed out two suspected terrorists as Pakistani. Islamabad has denied any role and called for a neutral investigation.', ""Pakistan would only isolate and harm itself further if it makes the first move in a military conflict. I don't see why they would attack first unless it is for nationalistic chest thumping.

The two countries have such a complicated history, and it’s hard not to feel uneasy whenever a new claim or accusation is made. I remember a few years ago when I was traveling in that region, I was talking to some locals in the border areas, and they expressed a lot of frustration and fear over how the military and political rhetoric can escalate so quickly. There’s this constant feeling that even small incidents can blow up and lead to bigger problems. I can’t even imagine what it’s like for the people living there, just trying to go about their daily lives.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen and heard, both sides seem to play a dangerous game of one-upmanship, and it often feels like the people paying the price are those who just want peace. I’ve read reports of skirmishes, misinformation, and propaganda on both sides, and it makes it even harder to understand the truth of what’s going on. As an outsider, it’s easy to form opinions, but I try to remain cautious about drawing conclusions without understanding the full context. Do others think the situation has been escalating recently, or is this just another instance of political theater? It’s hard to keep track of what’s real and what’s just fueling the fire.', ""Never interrupt your enemy as they're making unforced errors. India simply needs to raise the spectre of water denial to exacerbate internal tensions between Sindh and Punjab in Pakistan, while supporting the Baloch insurgency, and ensuring the Taliban remain hostile to Islamabad / Rawalpindi.

ISA basically mean tax free, there are a few types of ISA account - e.g. Cash ISA is regular money saving account, but Stocks & Shares ISA also very popular. I have one of those with iweb (part of lloyds) as it does not have holding fee, big selection of funds etc, £5 transaction fee I think but since I chuck my allowance in at the start of the year and only make a single transaction its ok. I typically buy a fund called Fidelity Index World P (I do have some of their USA fund as well) since its passive, cheap, line goes up - the usual. Has served me very well and I know said fund was very popular on other platforms like AJ Bell (its also recommended on places like Hargreaves Lansdown - which is one of the more old school/guard investment platforms).\n\nSIPP is private pension, becoming more popular I feel, I chuck a bit of money in each month (I think the most you can put into pensions - across all pensions - is approx 50k) and the government tops up with 20%. I use Invest Engine because no fees, doesn\'t have the same choice as iweb and its basically just ETFs but even then they have a plentiful selection and always adding more.\n\nThen have a general investing account, not something I really dabble with much anymore, mostly stuff I bought a while ago, and liked to use to make me feel bigly smart, as I had more gains until Donald dumbass returned.\n\n* Products etc\n\nI mean you can invest virtually anywhere so long as your vendor has the listing, guess currency exchange is a concern but not usually, plenty of GBP stuff after all. I think a lot of people here invest a lot in USA for example, moreso than the UK; in both ETFs and shares.\n\nBuying the funds...so in general in the UK I don\'t think investing is as popular as say the USA. Don\'t get me wrong there are plenty of people doing it and you can find lots of help and advice, but it isn\'t so widespread in the culture. However that seems to be changing, apps like Trading212 are becoming a lot more popular and I think people finally notice how useful things like ISAs are and just saving and investing money in general. Given the younger generations wasting their brain looking at smartphone, it good business to have a slick modern app. Another anecdote, I think with the older generations, my parents for example, who do have some investment account, but they don\'t lean toward DIY, more like hand over the money and have it invested for you (something like a Vanguard lifestrategy portfolio), but again, think that will change in time.\n\nServices also vary widly. My iweb ISA for example, the interface for that is ancient lol and I don\'t use an app (don\'t think they even have one) which is fine for how I invest there. Invest Engine is a lot more impressive with its design and features, very modern (Trading212 is also slick).\n\nThere seems to be a lot of competition amongst providers as well which is good, for example my SIPP used to be with Vanguard until they slapped on more fees, so I moved to Invest Engine which was relatively painless (you can also transfer ISAs) so you can shop around for the best service/provider and that obviously means the various platforms want to provide better service. Another example is that to get an iweb account used to cost a one time £100 charge (though for me they gave me back the £100 on my account) which was the price of no fees, but now they no longer charge you - because no holding fees is very common now. I think these providers all see the potential in larger market, more people investing and they want to compete to get these customers.\n\nSo I think the general story in the UK is that some people invest, but nowhere near as many as the USA, but there is move toward it as better providers and services entice people - especially younger (its advertised a lot more on TV for example). Even the government wants to encourage because its rumoured our chancellor is going to change the tax free ISA allowance (the 20k figure). Potentially in future we will only be allowed to put 4k of that 20k into a regular cash isa and the rest would have to go into stocks and shares isa (at the moment you split the allowance as you like) which would shake things up, should make people look into stuff like index funds a lot more at least...\n\nFor me personally I\'m holding all this stuff for the next 20-30 years anyway, so its all just a slightly different version of ""buy fund and chill"" which I think is most popular, if they aren\'t buying certain stocks then its going to be index/passive rather than going for actively managed imo.'], ['Yes. But LTCG is taxed at only 12.5%. Why to waste loss on this. Carry forward to future years and set it off against business income falling in 30% bracket.

The income can be a business/profession, earnings from a home, or other sources. Essentially, it reduces your total tax liability.\n\nIf you're filing on your own, consider using [ClearTax](https://cleartax.in/) — it automatically detects F&O and capital gains data, applies set-offs correctly, and ensures you don’t miss out on tax-saving opportunities like this.

I have had most of these in my Roth IRA and IRA since 2018 or before.'], ['I will try and follow the bullet points a bit because I have tendency to drone (I will fail to not do this)...I am in the UK\n\n* Stocks and Shares ISA, SIPP, general investment account\n\nIn UK we get £20,000 ISA allowance each year. ISA basically mean tax free, there are a few types of ISA account - e.g. Cash ISA is regular money saving account, but Stocks & Shares ISA also very popular. I have one of those with iweb (part of lloyds) as it does not have holding fee, big selection of funds etc, £5 transaction fee I think but since I chuck my allowance in at the start of the year and only make a single transaction its ok. I typically buy a fund called Fidelity Index World P (I do have some of their USA fund as well) since its passive, cheap, line goes up - the usual. Has served me very well and I know said fund was very popular on other platforms like AJ Bell (its also recommended on places like Hargreaves Lansdown - which is one of the more old school/guard investment platforms).\n\nSIPP is private pension, becoming more popular I feel, I chuck a bit of money in each month (I think the most you can put into pensions - across all pensions - is approx 50k) and the government tops up with 20%. I use Invest Engine because no fees, doesn\'t have the same choice as iweb and its basically just ETFs but even then they have a plentiful selection and always adding more.\n\nThen have a general investing account, not something I really dabble with much anymore, mostly stuff I bought a while ago, and liked to use to make me feel bigly smart, as I had more gains until Donald dumbass returned.\n\n* Products etc\n\nI mean you can invest virtually anywhere so long as your vendor has the listing, guess currency exchange is a concern but not usually, plenty of GBP stuff after all. I think a lot of people here invest a lot in USA for example, moreso than the UK; in both ETFs and shares.\n\nBuying the funds...so in general in the UK I don\'t think investing is as popular as say the USA. Don\'t get me wrong there are plenty of people doing it and you can find lots of help and advice, but it isn\'t so widespread in the culture. However that seems to be changing, apps like Trading212 are becoming a lot more popular and I think people finally notice how useful things like ISAs are and just saving and investing money in general. Given the younger generations wasting their brain looking at smartphone, it good business to have a slick modern app. Another anecdote, I think with the older generations, my parents for example, who do have some investment account, but they don\'t lean toward DIY, more like hand over the money and have it invested for you (something like a Vanguard lifestrategy portfolio), but again, think that will change in time.\n\nServices also vary widly. My iweb ISA for example, the interface for that is ancient lol and I don\'t use an app (don\'t think they even have one) which is fine for how I invest there. Invest Engine is a lot more impressive with its design and features, very modern (Trading212 is also slick).\n\nThere seems to be a lot of competition amongst providers as well which is good, for example my SIPP used to be with Vanguard until they slapped on more fees, so I moved to Invest Engine which was relatively painless (you can also transfer ISAs) so you can shop around for the best service/provider and that obviously means the various platforms want to provide better service. Another example is that to get an iweb account used to cost a one time £100 charge (though for me they gave me back the £100 on my account) which was the price of no fees, but now they no longer charge you - because no holding fees is very common now. I think these providers all see the potential in larger market, more people investing and they want to compete to get these customers.\n\nSo I think the general story in the UK is that some people invest, but nowhere near as many as the USA, but there is move toward it as better providers and services entice people - especially younger (its advertised a lot more on TV for example). Even the government wants to encourage because its rumoured our chancellor is going to change the tax free ISA allowance (the 20k figure). Potentially in future we will only be allowed to put 4k of that 20k into a regular cash isa and the rest would have to go into stocks and shares isa (at the moment you split the allowance as you like) which would shake things up, should make people look into stuff like index funds a lot more at least...\n\nFor me personally I\'m holding all this stuff for the next 20-30 years anyway, so its all just a slightly different version of ""buy fund and chill"" which I think is most popular, if they aren\'t buying certain stocks then its going to be index/passive rather than going for actively managed imo.'], ['Yes. But LTCG is taxed at only 12.5%. Why to waste loss on this. Carry forward to future years and set it off against business income falling in 30% bracket. If you think you are not going to earn that much money, then use it off this year.', ""As per Section 43(5) of the Income Tax Act, income or loss from F&O is classified as non-speculative business income. Therefore, it is necessary to declare profit/loss from F&O as Business Income under the PGBP head (PGBP Profits & Gains from Business and Profession).\n\nYes, you can use your ₹1.5 lakh F&O loss to reduce your tax liability, but only partially.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\n* ₹2.86 lakh gain from liquid funds bought before 1 April 2023 is considered long-term capital gain (LTCG) and taxed at 12.5% without indexation. → F&O loss can be set off against LTCG upto the extent of loss on F&O i.e,1.5lakhs, so the extra amount of ₹2.86lakh-₹1.5lakh=₹1.36lakhs will be taxed at 12.5%. → Tax = ₹17,000 (plus cess)\n* ₹1 lakh gain from liquid funds bought after 1 April 2023 is short-term capital gain (STCG) and taxed at your 5% slab rate. → You can set off ₹1 lakh from your F&O loss against this,however complete loss has already been setoff from LTCG. \n*  So taxable LTCG: ₹2.86L-₹1.5L=₹1.36L → ₹17,000 tax and STCG (₹1L): → ₹5,000 tax(On slab rate), therefore tax saved: ₹18,750\n\nF&O loss is deductible from any income except your salary. The income can be a business/profession, earnings from a home, or other sources. Essentially, it reduces your total tax liability.\n\nIf you're filing on your own, consider using [ClearTax](https://cleartax.in/) — it automatically detects F&O and capital gains data, applies set-offs correctly, and ensures you don’t miss out on tax-saving opportunities like this.

Whether this results in a physical conflict or not remains up in the air, but the possibility of such a conflict remains. A look at similar conflicts from the past century has shown that this could result in a brutal insurgency that might last for generations, and would result in dramatic reshapings of not just domestic politics but also global alliances as well.', ""Ideas to consider from this article:\n\n>The idea of a war between Canada and the United States was inconceivable even a few months ago. Most Americans still don’t believe it’s a possibility, or simply haven’t noticed their president’s occupationist rhetoric, or can’t imagine a world in which a neighbor they have been at peace with for 150 years is suddenly an enemy. The very idea seems completely absurd.\n>\n>But Canada does not have the luxury of dismissing White House rhetoric as trolling. Canadians are imagining the unimaginable because they have to.\n>\n>...\n>\n>What would a continental conflict look like? Conventional war between the United States and Canada would be highly asymmetric, to say the least. The U.S. possesses an enormous military, comprising more than a million men and women under arms. Canada’s armed forces have 72,000 active members. Even worse, because of its deep-seated trust in the United States, Canada has built its forces around interoperability with U.S. forces, both for mutual continental protection, in binational projects such as the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), and for expeditionary forces such as the NATO mission to Afghanistan.\n>\n>...\n>\n>Aisha Ahmad, a political-science professor at the University of Toronto, told me she does not think Canada’s reputation for gentleness would make it any less brutal as an opponent. “There’s no such thing as a warrior race,” said Ahmad, who is an expert on insurgency who has conducted field work in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Lebanon, Mali, and Kenya. “Nobody is born an insurgent. Insurgency is what happens when someone kills your mom.” Just one soldier firing on a protester at a rally could be the spark. “All of these cute, latte-drinking TikToker students,” she said. “You look at them and you don’t see insurgents. But if you kill their moms, the Geneva Convention will not save you.”\n>\n>An occupying military force has three strategies for dealing with insurgent conflicts, none of which work. The first we could call “Groznification”: complete suppression, as the Russian army did in Chechnya at the turn of the century. Even the destruction of any means of resistance works only temporarily, as Colonel Gaddafi learned in Libya. “Hearts and minds,” the strategy applied in Iraq and Afghanistan, is also ineffective: If you build hospitals and then fill them with corpses, you just generate more insurgents. The third option is “decapitation,” but the systematic targeting of insurgent networks’ leaders—the idea behind the recent U.S. air strikes on the Houthis in Yemen—can easily be countered by detailed succession plans. And killing leadership has the unintended consequence of fragmenting the insurgency’s power structures, so that, if you ever do want to negotiate a peaceful settlement, you have dozens of mini-insurgencies to deal with, rather than a single contained force.\n>\n>The Canadian population would present particular challenges to any counterinsurgency strategy. “The Taliban would look lightweight,” Ahmad told me. “Canada has all of the attributes to have an even fiercer insurgency than the other places in the world where I study these problems.” Canada has the most educated population in the Group of Seven advanced industrial nations, which for a resistance movement would be “an asset in being able to identify pressure points, in being able to know what critical infrastructure is, in being able to develop technology and weapons that can be highly disruptive,” Ahmad said. “The scale and the capacity would be so much higher.” If only one in 100 Canadians took up arms against an American occupation, that force would be 10 times the estimated size of the Taliban at the outset of the Afghan War. And that force would consist of machine-learning specialists and petroleum engineers rather than shepherds and subsistence farmers.\n>\n>...\n>\n>Already, the once-unthinkable idea of a war between Canada and the United States is growing less unthinkable. Before the 2024 U.S. election, 12 percent of Republicans viewed Canadians as “unfriendly” or “an enemy.” Now that number is 27 percent. Persuading the military to carry out an attack on Canada would probably be more difficult than convincing the population to support such an attack. The American officer class is trained, from the beginning, in “the duty not to follow orders,” and combat operations against Canada would involve fighting against fellow soldiers who shed blood beside them in Afghanistan and other theaters. Canadian and American soldiers have attended a great number of one another’s funerals.\n>\n>But turning the U.S. military is far from impossible. The Trump administration fired the commander of a Space Force base in Greenland the moment she expressed a position wavering from his annexationist aims there. The Naval Academy has already purged its library and canceled various speakers. At least some of the U.S. military’s leaders are on board with the ideological purification of their institutions.\n>\n>The conditions required for the occupation of Canada would also mean the end of American democracy. That, too, is not an impossible outcome—and a U.S. military adventure might even have both objectives in view. “The orchestration of a security crisis allows the incumbent government to declare emergency powers and bypass ordinary politics,” Ahmad said. “The Trump administration has already signaled that it wants a third term.” The 2028 election will be a watershed. If Trump decides to run again, a manufactured emergency over Canada would be a convenient excuse for overturning the constitutional barriers.\n\nAn attack is likely to be catastrophic for both nations and their allies, and will likely last far longer than a few months or years despite the vastly asymmetric capacities of each country's military forces. It would be foolhardy to discount the ongoing rhetoric and the current machinations of the American president as mere words, but rather a prelude to something worse.
